# Testing framework for porting and optimizing Quantum computing - AMAMN Framework

We use many computers every day.   
  
Most of the computers are 32-bit or 64-bit conventional personal or conventional supercomputers.  
  
We will continue to use conventional computers forever.  
  
Conventional computers are already reaching their performance limits.  
  
Quantum computers use quantum rotation to process operations in qubits.  It's much more efficient than conventional computers.  
  
We believe that we can contribute to our daily lives with less energy while the earth's resources are depleted.  It's not a big deal, but in everyday life where one person lives.  
  
Conventional computers and quantum computers will continue to operate forever.  
  
Conventional computers and Quantum computers are already connected.  
  
Are they really connected correctly?  Are they working properly?  
  
We will continue to research methods for validating and testing it.
